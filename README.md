Suricata Alert & Log Analysis Lab
üìå Overview

This project demonstrates how to create, trigger, and analyze Suricata rules using a sample packet capture file. Suricata is an open-source intrusion detection system (IDS), intrusion prevention system (IPS), and network security monitoring tool.
In this lab, I worked with custom rules, processed packet data, and explored both fast.log and eve.json outputs.

üéØ Objectives

Understand the structure of Suricata rules (action, header, and options).

Create and modify custom Suricata detection rules.

Trigger alerts using a .pcap file and Suricata in IDS mode.

Analyze alerts in:

fast.log ‚Äì Quick, human-readable alert log.

eve.json ‚Äì Detailed JSON-formatted event log for deeper analysis.

üõ† Tools & Files

Suricata ‚Äì IDS/IPS & network analysis tool.

sample.pcap ‚Äì Example network traffic for testing rules.

custom.rules ‚Äì File containing custom Suricata detection rules.

fast.log ‚Äì Quick alert log.

eve.json ‚Äì Detailed event log in JSON format.

jq ‚Äì Command-line JSON processor.

üìÇ Lab Workflow
1Ô∏è‚É£ Examine the Custom Rule
cat custom.rules


Example Rule:

alert http $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"GET on wire"; flow:established,to_server; content:"GET"; http_method; sid:12345; rev:3;)


Breakdown:

Action: alert

Protocol: http

Source ‚Üí Destination: $HOME_NET any ‚Üí $EXTERNAL_NET any

Options: msg, flow, content, sid, rev

2Ô∏è‚É£ Run Suricata with Custom Rule
sudo suricata -r sample.pcap -S custom.rules -k none


-r ‚Üí Read packets from file.

-S ‚Üí Load custom rule file.

-k none ‚Üí Disable checksum validation.

3Ô∏è‚É£ View Quick Alerts (fast.log)
cat /var/log/suricata/fast.log


Example Output:

11/23/2022-12:38:34.624866 [**] [1:12345:3] GET on wire [**] {TCP} 172.21.224.2:49652 -> 142.250.1.139:80

4Ô∏è‚É£ Analyze Detailed Logs (eve.json)
jq . /var/log/suricata/eve.json | less


Extract specific fields:

jq -c "[.timestamp,.flow_id,.alert.signature,.proto,.dest_ip]" /var/log/suricata/eve.json


Filter by flow_id:

jq "select(.flow_id==14500150016149)" /var/log/suricata/eve.json

üìä Key Learnings

Rule structure: Action ‚Üí Header ‚Üí Options.

fast.log is good for quick checks but eve.json is better for detailed analysis.

flow_id helps correlate events in the same network conversation.

Suricata variables like $HOME_NET and $EXTERNAL_NET simplify rule writing.
